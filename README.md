# ⚒️ Copilot Forge — Purview Data Security

> **AI-powered prompt engineering & investigation framework for Microsoft Security Copilot + Purview**

A field-ready **6-agent system** with **9 prompt books** for Data Security CSAs, analysts, and administrators to generate and operationalize Security Copilot prompts, agents, and promptbooks for Purview data security investigations.

---

## 🧠 What Is Copilot Forge?

A complete **6-agent AI system** that can handle any Security Copilot + Purview request — from scratch.

**Describe what you need in plain language. The agents do the rest.**

| 💬 You say... | 🤖 Agent responds... |
|---|---|
| *"Can SC detect USB file copies?"* | 🧪 **Knowledge Agent** answers with capabilities, limitations, and example prompts |
| *"Generate prompts for healthcare DLP triage"* | ⚡ **Prompt Generator** crafts production-ready SC prompts from scratch |
| *"Investigate: employee downloaded 500 files"* | 🔍 **Investigation Agent** builds a complete playbook with decision trees |
| *"Prepare a demo for a financial services CISO"* | 🎯 **Demo Architect** designs scenarios, scripts, and hands-on labs |
| *"I need triage + investigation + reporting + workshop"* | 🎛️ **Orchestrator** splits the work across all agents, delivers unified output |
| *"Validate these prompts before I show the customer"* | ✅ **Quality Reviewer** checks everything against real SC capabilities |

**Core purpose:** Help CSAs scale the use of Security Copilot for data security investigations with their customers.

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

### 🔑 Access & Licensing
- **Security Copilot access** (assigned via Microsoft Security admin center)
- **Purview role assignment** (DLP Admin, IRM Admin, or equivalent)
- **SCU capacity** for your tenant (each prompt/agent call costs SCUs)
- **Commercial cloud** (FedRAMP High commercial is GA; GCC not yet)

### 🔧 Configuration
- **Purview plugin enabled** in SC (Sources > Plugins > Purview toggle)
- **Appropriate RBAC** in Purview for your role
- **DLP active mode policies** (DLP Triage Agent does not work with simulation mode)

### 💡 Recommended
- SC experience or familiarity with copilot-driven investigation
- Understanding of your Purview policies (DLP, IRM, sensitivity labels)
- A test tenant for experimenting with new prompts
