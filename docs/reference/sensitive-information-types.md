**Last Updated:** April 2026
**Status:** [VALIDATED]
**Purpose:** Exact built-in SIT names for use in Security Copilot prompts to ensure correct detection mapping

---

## Why This Matters

When prompts reference "credit card numbers" or "social security numbers," Security Copilot may not always map to the correct built-in Sensitive Information Type. Using the exact SIT name ensures SC queries the right detection logic and returns accurate results.

**Usage Pattern:**
```
What DLP alerts were triggered by the sensitive information type
"Credit Card Number" or "U.S. Social Security Number (SSN)"
in the past 30 days?
```

## 6. Common Custom SIT Patterns

Organizations frequently create custom SITs. When prompting SC about custom SITs, use the exact custom SIT display name as configured in the Purview compliance portal.

**SC Limitation:** Custom SIT regex internals may produce opaque match explanations. If SC cannot explain why a custom SIT matched, reference the custom SIT name and ask SC to show the content metadata and match count instead.

**Prompt Pattern for Custom SITs:**
```
Summarize the DLP alert with ID <alertId>. The alert triggered on a custom
sensitive information type named "<ExactCustomSITName>". Show the match count,
confidence level, and the policy rule that detected it.
```

## Usage in Prompts

### Correct (use exact SIT name):
```
Show DLP alerts where the sensitive information type "Credit Card Number"
was detected with high confidence (>85%) in the past 7 days.
```

### Incorrect (vague reference):
```
Show DLP alerts about credit card data in the past 7 days.
```

The exact SIT name ensures SC queries the right detection engine and returns only relevant alerts.
