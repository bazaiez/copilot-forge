2. Actions to prevent:
   - What should we block? (email external, cloud upload, print, copy to USB, etc.)
   - What should we log but allow (monitor without blocking)?
   - What user actions should trigger notification?

3. Exceptions and business needs:
   - Legitimate use cases (e.g., "Finance emails PO with card numbers to vendor")
   - Users/roles that need exceptions?
   - How to handle legitimate needs (approved override process?)

4. Regulatory/compliance requirements:
   - Are specific DLP controls required? (PCI-DSS, GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)
   - Required logging for audit?

Based on this, recommend:

- Rule conditions: what patterns/keywords/data types to detect?
- Sensitivity level (high confidence vs. low confidence rules)
- Actions: block, log, notify, or prompt user?
- Exceptions: approved groups, file types, locations
- User notifications: what message should users see?
- Incident reports: what gets logged and retained?

Also provide:
- Testing methodology (how to validate rule works before deployment)
- Tuning recommendations (balance protection vs. false positives)

   - Examples of content that should be auto-labeled
   - False positive scenarios (what might we mislabel?)

2. Confidence levels:
   - Should we use exact match (high confidence) or keyword matching (broader)?
   - What confidence threshold for applying label automatically?
   - What happens if confidence is below threshold (notify user, ignore, etc.)?

3. Scope:
   - Which workloads: SharePoint, Teams, Exchange, OneDrive, other?
   - Which sites/users does this apply to?
   - Any exclusions (certain file types, locations)?

4. Label to apply:
   - Which label should auto-labeling use?
   - Can users override the auto-label?
   - What notification should users see?

   - All relevant workloads covered? (SharePoint, Teams, Exchange, etc.)
   - All applicable users/departments included?

3. Alignment:
   - Does this policy align with our data protection strategy?
   - Any policies that conflict or overlap?
   - Are there protection gaps (data types with no policy)?

4. Effectiveness:
   - How many violations has this policy detected in past 90 days?
   - Trend: increasing, decreasing, stable?
   - User feedback: too strict, not helpful, or good?

5. Maintenance:
   - When was this policy last reviewed?
   - Any changes needed due to business/regulatory changes?
   - Is this policy still needed or can it be retired?

Based on audit, recommend:

- Policies to strengthen (tighten scope, increase detection)
- Policies to simplify or consolidate
- Policies with detection issues (tune patterns/thresholds)
- Policies to retire (no longer needed)
- Coverage gaps (new policies needed)
- Prioritization for changes (by impact and effort)

Also provide:
