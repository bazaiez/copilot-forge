2. Save it to `playbooks/` with a clear name
3. Structure the playbook:
   - Title and scenario description
   - Role and assumed audience

## Naming Conventions

- **Directories:** lowercase, hyphens, plural (e.g., `prompts/`, `playbooks/`, `use-cases/`)
- **Files:** lowercase with hyphens (e.g., `investigate-data-exfiltration.md`)
- **Prompt IDs:** Module-category-sequence (e.g., `dlp-incident-response-001`)
- **Branches:** feature/brief-description (e.g., `feature/add-dspm-prompts`)

---

## Quality Standards

### Tested > Theoretical
- Prompts should be tested against real Security Copilot when possible
- If untested, clearly label as "theoretical" and explain why
- Document actual SC behavior and quirks discovered during testing

### Honest About Limitations
- Every prompt and playbook should include a "Limitations" section
- Be clear about what SC cannot do or what requires manual steps
- Document known plugin gaps and workarounds

### Completeness
- All required template fields must be filled
- Don't leave "TODO" or placeholder text in submissions
- Include examples when available
- Cross-reference related content

### Clarity
- Use clear, concise language
- Assume the reader is familiar with Purview but may be new to Security Copilot
- Include screenshots or examples where helpful
- Define acronyms on first use
