# Unified Audit Log Operation Names Reference

**Last Updated:** April 2026
**Status:** [VALIDATED]
**Purpose:** Exact operation names for use in Security Copilot prompts to prevent SC mapping failures

---

## Why This Matters

Security Copilot sometimes fails to map natural language descriptions (e.g., "downloads" or "file sharing") to the correct Unified Audit Log (UAL) operation names. When this happens, SC either returns incomplete results or queries the wrong activity type entirely.

**Solution:** Include exact operation names in your prompts as anchors. Instead of asking SC to find "file downloads," ask for `FileDownloaded`, `FileSyncDownloadedFull`, etc. This forces SC to query the correct audit events.

**Usage Pattern:**
```
Analyze audit logs for user <user> looking specifically for these operations:
[EXACT_OPERATION_NAMES]. For each occurrence, provide the timestamp,
target resource, and whether a DLP policy matched.
```

## Usage Examples in Security Copilot Prompts

### Example 1: DLP + File Exfiltration Investigation
```
Analyze audit logs for user <user> in the past 30 days. Look specifically
for these operations: FileDownloaded, FileSyncDownloadedFull,
FileCreatedOnRemovableMedia, FileCopiedToRemovableMedia,
FileUploadedToCloud, SharingSet, AnonymousLinkCreated, Send.

For each occurrence, provide:
- Timestamp and workload
- File or resource name
- Destination (external domain, USB device, cloud app)
- Whether a DLP policy matched (DLPRuleMatch)
```

### Example 2: Email Forwarding Rule Investigation
```
Check for suspicious mail flow changes for user <user> in the past 14 days.
Look specifically for these operations: New-InboxRule, Set-InboxRule,
UpdateInboxRules, Set-Mailbox.

For each rule found, show:
- Rule name and conditions
- Forwarding destination (especially external domains)
- When the rule was created or modified
- Whether the rule is still active
```

### Example 3: Evidence Destruction Detection
```
Analyze audit logs for user <user> in the past 7 days for evidence of
file or email deletion. Look for these operations: FileDeleted,
FileDeletedFirstStageRecycleBin, FileDeletedSecondStageRecycleBin,
SoftDelete, HardDelete, MoveToDeletedItems, FileRecycled.

For each deletion:
- What was deleted and when
- Was the content sensitive (any DLP match history)?
- Was deletion followed by recycle bin purge?
- Timeline correlation with other suspicious activities
```
