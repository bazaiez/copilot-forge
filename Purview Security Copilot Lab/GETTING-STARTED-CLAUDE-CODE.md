## ⚙️ Step 2: Understand What Happens Automatically

When you open this repo, Claude automatically reads `CLAUDE.md`. This loads:

- 🤖 The complete 6-agent system (Orchestrator, Knowledge, Prompt Generator, Investigation, Demo Architect, Quality Reviewer)
- 🔌 All 6 validated Purview plugin capabilities
- ⚠️ Known SC limitations
- 📐 Prompt design rules, patterns, and taxonomy
- 📂 The full repository structure

**You don't need to configure anything. Just start talking.**

---

## 💬 Step 3: Talk to the Agents

The Orchestrator Agent receives every request and routes it to the right specialist. You don't need to know which agent handles what — just describe what you need.

### 🧪 Ask a Question

```
Can Security Copilot detect when someone copies files to USB?
```
The **Knowledge Agent** answers with capabilities, limitations, prerequisites, and example prompts.

### ⚡ Generate Prompts for a Use Case

```
Generate prompts for a SOC team triaging 200 DLP alerts per day in financial services
```
The **Prompt Generator Agent** creates complete, copy-paste-ready SC prompts from scratch. No templates.

### 🔍 Investigate an Incident

```
Investigate: a departing employee downloaded 500 confidential files to personal OneDrive last week
```
The **Investigation Agent** builds a step-by-step playbook with SC prompts at every step, decision trees, remediation actions, and escalation criteria.

### 🎬 Prepare a Customer Demo

```
I have a healthcare customer meeting Friday. They want to see how SC handles PHI protection. 
Their SOC team has 5 analysts and they triage about 100 DLP alerts per day.
```
The **Demo Architect Agent** designs a complete demo package: realistic scenarios, SC prompt scripts, narration, talking points, Q&A preparation, and hands-on lab exercises.

### 🎛️ Handle a Complex Scenario

```
Financial services customer with insider risk concerns, 500 alerts/day, 3-person SOC. 
I need: triage prompts + investigation playbook + executive reporting + a half-day workshop.
```
The **Orchestrator** splits this across all agents, coordinates the work, and delivers a unified package.

### ✅ Quality Check Before Delivery

```
Review these prompts I wrote and validate them against real SC capabilities
```
The **Quality Reviewer Agent** checks every prompt against the 6 validated capabilities, flags issues, and provides corrected versions.

## 🤖 The 6 Agents

```
👤 You  →  🎛️ Orchestrator  →  Specialist Agents  →  ✅ Quality Reviewer  →  📦 Output
```

| Agent | What It Does | When to Use |
|---|---|---|
| 🎛️ **Orchestrator** | Routes requests, plans, coordinates, synthesizes | Always (default — receives all requests) |
| 🧪 **Knowledge** | Answers SC + Purview capability questions | "Can SC do X?", "What are the limitations?" |
| ⚡ **Prompt Generator** | Crafts SC prompts from scratch for any use case | "Generate prompts for..." |
| 🔍 **Investigation** | Builds incident response playbooks | "Investigate...", "What happened with..." |
| 🎬 **Demo Architect** | Designs customer demos and workshops | "Prepare a demo for...", "Workshop ideas" |
| ✅ **Quality Reviewer** | Validates all outputs against real capabilities | Before any customer delivery |

## 💡 Tips

- 🎯 **Be specific about customer context** — industry, team size, pain points, and data types produce better results
- 📓 **Ask for promptbooks** — multi-step workflows are more useful than single prompts
- ⚠️ **Request limitations** — every output should include what SC cannot do
- 🏷️ **Check validation status** — [VALIDATED] means tested and working; [ASPIRATIONAL] means untested
- 🔤 **Use exact names** — SC works better with exact SIT names ("Credit Card Number") and audit log operations (FileDownloaded) than natural language approximations
