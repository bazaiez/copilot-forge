- Product demo (10-15 min slot)
- Customer workshop opening
- Sales meeting (show value quickly)
- Board presentation (impress executives)

**Exact Prompt:**
```
Quick data risk summary for our organization.

Provide:
1. Overall data risk score
2. Top 3 data risks and why they matter
3. Quick win we could address today

Keep it brief and visual - this is a 2-minute demo!
```

**Expected Output:**
- Risk score (Low/Medium/High/Critical) with visual indicator
- Top 3 bullets on major risks
- 1-2 sentence "quick win" suggestion
- Clean, presentation-ready format

**Limitations:**
- May be limited if org has minimal Purview data
- Customer may ask follow-up questions; have deep-dive prompt ready

**Tips:**
- Run this in customer's production environment (shows real data)

## 2. Live Demo: "Show Me Who Has Access to Our Most Sensitive Data"

**Title:** High-Risk User Access Discovery

**Purpose:** Demonstrate SC's ability to quickly identify over-privileged users and access anomalies.

**When to Use:**
- Demo for data governance team
- Compliance officer presentation
- Access control workshop
- Sales meeting (wow factor: "see what your team can access?")

**Exact Prompt:**
```
Identify the top 10 users with access to our most sensitive data
(PII, financial, confidential):

For each user show:
1. Their name/department
2. Types of sensitive data they can access
3. Is this access appropriate for their role? Flag if over-privileged
4. Any unusual access patterns (off-hours, anomalous locations)?

This is for customer demo - make it compelling and actionable!
```

**Expected Output:**
- User list with sensitivity levels (what data they access)
- Risk flag for each user (green = appropriate, yellow = review, red = over-privileged)
- Quick assessment of risk level
- Sample remediation action ("Remove access for users #3, #5, #7")

**Limitations:**
- Accuracy depends on complete access and role catalog
- Some over-access may be legitimate (require manual review)
- May need follow-up investigation if customer wants to act

**Tips:**
- This usually gets excited reaction (people are surprised by access)
- Have next step ready: "Want us to do access review for your team?"
- Don't speculate on intent; just flag risk and let customer investigate

## 3. Workshop Scenario: "Simulate a Data Breach Investigation"

**Title:** Incident Response Walkthrough

**Purpose:** Walk customers through incident investigation workflow using SC and Purview.

**When to Use:**
- Half-day workshop on incident response
- Security operations team training
- Playbook development session
- SIEM/SOAR integration discussion

**Exact Prompt:**
```
SCENARIO: We detected unusual activity on the "Customer PII" SharePoint
site on March 15. A user downloaded 500+ files and tried to email them
externally (email was blocked by DLP).

Walk through the investigation:

1. Timeline: What happened between 9 AM and 5 PM on March 15?
   - Who accessed the site?
   - What files were downloaded?
   - Were there any other suspicious activities?

2. User risk assessment:
   - Who is the user? What's their role?
   - Is their behavior baseline-normal or anomalous?
   - Any IRM signals or policy violations?

3. Data risk:
   - What data was accessed? (scope and sensitivity)
   - Was anything exfiltrated?

4. Next steps for the security team:
   - Immediate containment actions
   - Investigation priorities
   - Communication (who should be notified?)

Format as incident response runbook that the team could follow.
```

**Expected Output:**
- Chronological timeline of user activities
- Risk assessment narrative
- Data accessed summary
- Recommended containment steps
- Investigation checklist
- Escalation criteria and contacts
- Post-incident review checklist

**Limitations:**
- Depends on having realistic incident scenario data
- Actual incident may be messier/more complex than demo
- Response procedures require human decision-making (SC guides, doesn't decide)

**Tips:**
- Use a real incident from your org (anonymized) if available
- Pause after each section to let workshop participants discuss
- Highlight the speed (investigation that takes humans 4 hours, SC does in 5 min)

```
We're designing our sensitivity label taxonomy. 

Our business has these data types:
- Customer personal data (PII)
- Financial records and budgets
- Employee records (HR)
- Intellectual property
- Strategic plans
- Public marketing materials

For each data type, recommend:
1. Label name and level (we're thinking Public/Internal/Confidential/Highly Confidential)
2. Who should have access?
3. What protections should we apply? (encryption, external share restrictions, etc.)
4. Any special handling requirements?

Then suggest a finalized label taxonomy that would work for our organization.
```

**Expected Output:**
- Data type to label mapping
- Label descriptions (use cases, examples)
- Access control recommendations per label
- Protection settings (encryption, sharing restrictions, IRM)
- Sample documents/scenarios and how to label them
- Finalized label taxonomy (simplified, aligned to business needs)
- Rollout and user training recommendations

**Limitations:**
- Customer must make final decisions (SC can guide, not decide)
- Taxonomy may need adjustment post-launch
- Implementation requires actual portal configuration

**Tips:**
- This is a workshop exercise; encourage discussion
- Ask "do you agree?" at key decision points
- Mention it's iterative (can refine post-launch)
- Have label governance checklist ready (who approves changes, etc.)

then narrow down ("who sent it?" "what was in it?")
```

**Expected Output:**
- Lab instructions and scenario
- SC prompt templates for common investigation tasks
- Purview navigation guide
- Reference materials (how to find data, interpret results)
- Grading rubric (for trainer evaluation)
- Sample findings report (for comparison)
- Debrief talking points (key lessons learned)

**Limitations:**
- Requires customer data access; may need scrubbed/demo data
- Hands-on labs take time; fits in half-day workshop minimum
- Customer success depends on their data quality and completeness

**Tips:**
- Start with guided example (everyone does together)
- Then let groups explore autonomously
- Debrief as group (share findings and approaches)
- Highlight clever investigation paths ("nice use of that feature!")

## 7. "Did We Close the Risk?" Post-Incident Validation Demo

**Title:** Remediation Validation Prompt

**Purpose:** Show how SC can validate that security improvements have actually reduced risk.

**When to Use:**
- Post-incident review (show remediation worked)
- Policy change validation
- Customer confidence-building
- Compliance closure

**Exact Prompt:**
```
BEFORE/AFTER DEMO: Show how SC validates security improvements.

Context: Three months ago, we identified that [RISK: e.g., "50+ users
had over-privileged access to PII data"]. We implemented remediation:
[ACTION: e.g., "Automated monthly access reviews, removed over-privileged
accounts"].

Now validate that the risk is actually reduced:

1. Current state:
   - How many users currently have over-privileged access?
   - Trend: is this number decreasing month-over-month?

2. Before vs. after comparison:
   - Original risk score: [X]
   - Current risk score: [Y]
   - Risk reduction: Z%

3. Remaining risks:
   - What over-privileges still exist and why?
   - Are these acceptable (known exception) or still problematic?

4. Continuous monitoring:
   - How will we detect if this risk re-emerges?
   - What alerts or reviews are in place?

Format as "Remediation Success Report" for leadership.
```

**Expected Output:**
- Before/after risk metric comparison
- Percentage reduction in risk
- Remaining exceptions (documented and approved)
- Continuous monitoring strategy
- Success metrics to track going forward
- Sign-off (who approved this remediation?)

**Limitations:**
- Requires having implemented remediation to show results
- May not show full ROI if incident was prevented (hard to quantify)
- Some improvements take time; may not be evident in 30 days

**Tips:**
- This works great for incidents that were actually remediated
- Shows investment in security actually pays off
- Builds confidence for next remediation project
- Great for board reporting on security improvements

## 8. "Build Your Security Metrics Dashboard" Workshop

**Title:** KPI Definition and Tracking Workshop

**Purpose:** Help customers define and track security KPIs using SC-generated data.

**When to Use:**
- Metrics/KPI workshop (2-3 hours)
- Executive reporting setup
- Security scorecard design
- Monthly metrics review process

**Exact Prompt:**
```
WORKSHOP: Define security metrics for monthly leadership reporting.

Our organization wants to report monthly on data security posture.
Currently we track: [existing metrics if any]

Help us define:

1. Core KPIs (the ones we MUST track):
   - Sensitivity label coverage (what % of data is labeled?)
   - Compliance status (what % of regulatory requirements met?)
   - Data risk score (overall organizational data risk)
   - Incident metrics (count, MTTR, impact)

2. Health indicators (leading indicators of problems):
   - Policy violations (DLP blocks, email over-shares)
   - Access review completion (on schedule? findings?)
   - User training (% completed, effectiveness)
   - Audit findings (new issues? remediation progress?)

3. For each metric, define:
   - Calculation method
   - Data source (where does SC get this?)
   - Target/goal
   - Red/yellow/green thresholds
   - Who's accountable?

4. Dashboard design:
   - What visualization for each metric? (trending chart, scorecard, heatmap)
   - Frequency (daily, weekly, monthly)?
   - Distribution (who sees this dashboard?)

5. Reporting process:
   - Who generates the report? (manual, automated via SC?)
   - Cadence (weekly, monthly?)
   - Escalation (when/who if metrics go red?)

Provide sample dashboard mockup and monthly reporting checklist.
```

**Expected Output:**
- KPI definitions with calculation methodology
- Target/threshold definitions (red/yellow/green)
- Data source specification (SC queries, manual input, etc.)
- Sample dashboard visualization (mock-up)
- Monthly reporting template
- Roles and responsibilities
- KPI review cadence and escalation procedures
- Historical data (if available) for trending

**Limitations:**
- Some metrics require data from multiple sources (coordination needed)
- Targets should be data-driven (may need baseline period)
- Reporting automation depends on SC/Purview API availability

**Tips:**
- Start with 5-7 core KPIs (not 20; too much noise)
- Make targets realistic (stretch goals that are achievable)
- Show trending (more important than absolute numbers)
- Get leadership buy-in on definitions before implementing

## 9. "Spot the Risks" Guided Assessment

**Title:** Quick Risk Identification Workshop

**Purpose:** Train customer security team to use SC to identify common data risks in their environment.

**When to Use:**
- Half-day security team workshop
- Operational readiness training
- Customer enablement post-sale
- Quarterly team training

**Exact Prompt:**
```
GUIDED ASSESSMENT: Common data risks to look for in your organization.

This exercise trains your team to use SC to identify and prioritize risks.

For each risk category, ask SC:

1. Sensitivity label gaps:
   "What percentage of our sensitive data is unlabeled or mislabeled?"
   "Which data repositories have <70% label coverage?"

2. Access anomalies:
   "Identify users with access that seems over-privileged for their role."
   "Are there service accounts with unusual sensitive data access?"

3. Compliance exposure:
   "Are we compliant with [GDPR/HIPAA/CCPA]?"
   "What compliance gaps do we have and how urgent are they?"

4. Data movement risks:
   "Is sensitive data being shared externally inappropriately?"
   "Identify unauthorized external email shares of confidential data."

5. Policy violations:
   "What are our top DLP violations and patterns?"
   "Are violations concentrated in teams/groups (training opportunity)?"

For each risk found, practice:
- Assess severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- Identify root cause (config issue? user error? training gap?)
- Recommend remediation (quick fix? requires process change?)
- Estimate effort/timeline

Document findings in risk register and prioritize for action.

Time: 2-3 hours per category (can run over multiple sessions)
```

**Expected Output:**
- Guided assessment template with risk categories
- Sample SC prompts for each risk type
- Risk assessment framework (severity, root cause, remediation)
- Completed risk register from assessment
- Prioritized action list
- Ownership assignments (who owns each risk?)
- Trainer guide for facilitating assessment

**Limitations:**
- Takes time to work through all risk categories
- Some risks may require additional investigation
- Risk prioritization involves business judgment (not pure SC analysis)

**Tips:**
- Run this annually or quarterly
- Rotate team members so everyone learns
- Use this to populate risk register and roadmap
- Celebrate risks found and fixed (shows security program working)
