## Tags and Patterns

- **[VALIDATED]** Prompts 1, 3, 4, 6: Core SC capabilities for executive synthesis and compliance reporting. Real SC implementations use these patterns.
- **[VALIDATED]** Prompts 2, 5, 7: Incident communication and posture reporting leverage SC's ability to contextualize data risk for different audiences.
- **[ASPIRATIONAL]** Prompts 8: Requires cross-system risk aggregation and roadmap integration. Recommend customizing to your org's risk framework.

All prompts assume SC has access to Purview audit, alert, and risk data. Adapt terminology and compliance references to match your regulatory scope.
