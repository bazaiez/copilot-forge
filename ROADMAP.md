# 🗺️ Copilot Forge — Implementation Roadmap

**Author:** Bilel Azaiez — Microsoft CSA, with AI-assisted development

## 🟢 Current Status: Phase 4 Complete

Copilot Forge has reached production readiness with a fully implemented 6-agent system.

---

## Completed Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation -- COMPLETE
- Repository structure and documentation patterns established
- Key personas defined (CSA, SOC Analyst, Compliance Officer, Admin, Executive)
- Core use cases identified and cataloged

### Phase 2: Core Content -- COMPLETE
- 8 prompt books built (DLP, IRM, DSPM, Audit, MIP, Executive, Workshop, Operations)
- 4 investigation playbooks (DLP incident, IRM case triage, data leakage response, post-incident review)
- Prompt taxonomy with 9 categories and 10 design patterns
- Validation matrix tracking all prompt testing status

### Phase 3: Validation -- COMPLETE
- Prompts tested against live Security Copilot with Purview plugin
- 22 validated use cases in the catalog
- Limitations and blind spots documented honestly
- Audit log operation names and SIT exact names cataloged as reference data

### Phase 4: Multi-Agent System -- COMPLETE
- 6 production-ready agents built with full system prompts:
  - **Orchestrator Agent** — routes requests, plans multi-agent workflows, synthesizes outputs
  - **Knowledge Agent** — authoritative source on SC + Purview capabilities and limitations
  - **Prompt Generator Agent** — generates SC prompts from scratch for any use case
  - **Investigation Agent** — builds incident response playbooks with SC prompts, decision trees, remediation
  - **Demo Architect Agent** — designs customer demos, workshops, industry-specific scenarios
  - **Quality Reviewer Agent** — validates all outputs against real SC capabilities
- Agent Hub (single entry point) created
- 3 deployment topologies defined (Starter, Standard, Full)
- Example scenarios documented with agent flow walkthroughs

## Active Phase

### Phase 5: Automation and APIs (In Progress)

**Goals:**
- Integrate with Microsoft Graph API and Purview APIs for live data access
- Build MCP server prototype for real-time Purview data in Claude Desktop
- Design Logic App blueprints for alert-triggered agent workflows
- Prototype automated prompt execution pipeline

**Deliverables (planned):**
- API landscape and integration design document
- Logic App blueprint templates (alert-triggered investigation)
- MCP server for Purview API access
- Automation decision matrix (what to automate, what not to)
- Cost and licensing impact analysis

**Dependencies:**
- Graph API access and Purview API keys
- Azure Logic Apps access
- MCP SDK documentation

---

## Upcoming Phase

### Phase 6: Operationalization

**Goals:**
- Internal sharing and CSA community adoption
- Customer deployment success stories
- Feedback loops for continuous improvement
- Quarterly prompt revalidation process

**Deliverables (planned):**
- Polished repository for internal sharing
- Workshop materials and presentation deck
- Feedback collection mechanism
- Customer engagement success stories
- Quarterly review process for prompt validation
